Cache Design for the System

Problem Statement :

Design the following Caching System:
1. Set Associative Cache
2. Direct Mapped Cache
3. Fully Associative Cache

Caching Fetch/Flush Policy:
1. FIFO Policy
2. LRU Policy

Caching Write Policy
1. Write Back Cache
2. Write Through Cache

Provide Enough Logging to understand when there is a miss in the cache (Specify the miss too : Is it compulsory, conflict or capacity miss)

Also when implementing WriteBack cache, simulate how you would consider something as dirty and show the replacement of data that happens when there is a capacity miss.
